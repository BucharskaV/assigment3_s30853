# assigment3_s30853 - How to run the tests
My solution consits of 4 projects:
  1) Assigment3 - Geometric figures 
  2) Assigment3Part2 - Calculator
  3) TestAssigment3 - Tests for Part1 figures
  4) TestsAssigment3Part2 - Tests for calculator
Tests for Part 1 are separated by figures (TestsCube, TestsCylinder, TestsRectangle, TestsSphere). Tests for Calculator is represented in one class TestsCalculator.

Open Test Explorer, click on "Run all tests" or run tests separatly.

By CMD:

  dotnet test TestAssigment3
  
  dotnet test TestsAssigment3Part2
